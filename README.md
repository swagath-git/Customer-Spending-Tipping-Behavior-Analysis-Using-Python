# Data Analytics Project Using Python (Seaborn)
# Project Overview
This project showcases data analytics and visualization using Python libraries such as 
    1. Pandas
    2. NumPy
    3. Matplotlib
    4. Seaborn.
       It focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, identify trends, and visualize relationships between variables in a dataset.

# Objectives
     1. Clean and preprocess raw data
     2. Perform statistical and exploratory analysis
     3. Visualize data distributions and correlations
     4. Derive actionable insights using Seaborn plots
# Tools & Libraries
     1. Python
     2. Jupyter Notebook
     3. Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning
     4. NumPy – Numerical operations
     5. Matplotlib – Basic visualization
     6. Seaborn – Advanced and aesthetic data visualization

# Features
     1. Data cleaning and transformation
     2. Correlation heatmaps and pair plots
     3. Distribution and categorical analysis
     4. Trend identification through visuals
