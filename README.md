# Customer Spending & Tipping Behavior Analysis Using Python

# Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis using Python and Seaborn to uncover patterns, relationships, outliers and trends from the dataset. Multiple statistical visualizations were generated to support data-driven decision-making.

# Objective
To perform end-to-end EDA using Python and visually communicate insights through high-quality charts and graphs.

# Dataset
The dataset used contains multiple numerical and categorical variables suitable for exploratory visual analysis.

# Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

# Visualizations & Analysis Performed
The notebook includes:
- Distribution plots
- Count plots
- Bar charts
- Box plots & Violin plots
- Correlation heatmap
- Pair plot for multi-variable relationships

# Key Insights
- Visual patterns highlight trends across numerical features.
- Correlation heatmap reveals strong and weak variable relationships.
- Distribution plots helped detect skewness and outliers.
- Segment-wise analysis shows differences across groups/categories.
